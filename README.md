# aenet-python – Python tools for ænet

This package provides Python tools for the interaction with the *atomic energy network* (ænet) machine-learning interatomic potential software package.  To learn more about ænet, see the [ænet website](http://ann.atomistic.net/) and [GitHub repository](http://ann.atomistic.net/).

Common use cases for the tools within the `aenet-python`  package are

* Extraction of structures, energies, and forces from the output of first-principles calculations;
* Interconversion of atomic structure formats, especially conversion to ænet's XSF format;
* Manipulation of atomic structures, e.g., for generating reference data;
* Operations on the featurized reference data produced by ænet's `generate.x`; and
* Analysis of the outputs generated by ænet's `train.x`, i.e., from machine-learning potential training.

## Installation

Install the Python package as usual, for example with pip

    $ pip install --user .

To use the featurization capabilities, the main ænet package needs to be installed separately as described [elsewhere](http://ann.atomistic.net/documentation/).  And `aenet-python` needs to be made aware of the ænet installation path, for example, using its interactive configuration tool

    $ aenet config --set-aenet-path [path-to-aenet]

where `[path-to-aenet]` is the path pointing to the aenet root directory.

For more details, see the documentation.
