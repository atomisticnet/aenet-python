ænet Tools Documentation
========================

The ``aenet tools`` package is a collection of utilities for preparing
input files and processing output files for the
machine-learning potential software ænet (http://ann.atomistic.net).

Common use cases of the package are

* Extraction of structures, energies, and forces from the output of
  first-principles calculations;
* Interconversion of atomic structure formats, especially conversion to
  ænet's XSF format;
* Manipulation of atomic structure, e.g., for generating reference data;
* Operations on the featurized reference data produced by ænet's
  ``generate.x``; and
*  Analysis of the output generated by ænet's ``train.x``, i.e., from
   machine-learning potential training.

Much of the package's functionality is exposed through command-line
tools.  See :doc:`/usage/commandline` for an overview of the
command-line capabilities.
