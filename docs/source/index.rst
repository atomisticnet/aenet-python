ænet-python Documentation
===========================

The ``aenet-python`` package is a collection of utilities for preparing
input files and processing output files for the machine-learning
interatomic potential software `ænet <http://ann.atomistic.net>`_.

Common use cases of the package are

* Extraction of structures, energies, and forces from the output of
  first-principles calculations;
* Interconversion of atomic structure formats, especially conversion to
  ænet's XSF format;
* Manipulation of atomic structures, e.g., for generating reference data;
* Operations on the featurized reference data produced by ænet's
  ``generate.x``;
* Training of machine-learning interatomic potentials using ænet's
  ``train.x``; and
* Analysis of the outputs generated by ænet's ``train.x``, i.e., from
  machine-learning potential training.

Much of the package's functionality is exposed through command-line
tools.  Specifically, the tool ``sconv`` (*structure conversion*) makes
available capabilities for atomic structure modification and
interconversion and ``sfp`` (*structure fingerprints*) can be used to
featurize atomic structures.  In addition, the ``config`` tool can be
used for :doc:`configuration </usage/installation>`.

See :doc:`/usage/commandline` for an overview of the
command-line capabilities.
