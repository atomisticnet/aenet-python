ænet training set files
=======================

The object class ``TrnSet`` can be used to interact with data set files
that were produced by ænet's ``generate.x`` tool. 

.. note::
   The ænet executable ``trnset2ASCII.x`` needs to be configured to read
   training set files.  See also :doc:`installation`.
